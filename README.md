> Native Actors for Reason and OCaml

**Status**: ALPHA. Ready to play around with it.

## Local Setup

This project is setup and run with `esy`, so make sure you have that installed.

After that it's an `esy install` and `esy build` away.

An example is currently runnable via `esy dune exec
test/runtime/runtime_test.exe`.
